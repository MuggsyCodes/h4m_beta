    question: "Do you accept health insurance?",
    answer:
      "Hormones for Me does not communicate with health insurance companies for any of our services; even though the overall health of our clients is tremendously enhanced and they experience a better quality of life. Many health insurance providers donâ€™t see it this way and consider our services elective. Many customers have had success using FSA or HSA means of payment. Marek Health can provide copies of invoices and lab requisitions as needed. Because we are direct pay, and do not seek reimbursement from insurance providers, we cannot provide procedure codes (CPT) or diagnostic codes (ICD-10).",
